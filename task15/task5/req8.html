        <p>The dog (Canis familiaris or Canis lupus familiaris) is a 
            domesticated descendant of the wolf. Also called the domestic 
            dog, it was selectively bred from an extinct population of wolves 
            during the Late Pleistocene by hunter-gatherers. The dog was the 
            first species to be domesticated by humans, over 14,000 years ago 
            and before the development of agriculture. Experts estimate that 
            due to their long association with humans, dogs have gained the 
            ability to thrive on a starch-rich diet that would be inadequate 
            for other canids.</p>
