        Text messaging, or simply texting, is the act of composing and 
        <br>
        sending electronic messages, typically consisting of alphabetic 
        <br>
        and numeric characters, between two or more users of mobile phones, 
        <br>
        tablet computers, smartwatches, desktops/laptops, or another type of 
        <br>
        compatible computer. Text messages may be sent over a cellular network 
        <br>
        or may also be sent via satellite or Internet connection.
        <br>
        The term originally referred to messages sent using the Short Message Service 
        <br>
        (SMS) on mobile devices. It has grown beyond alphanumeric text to include 
        <br>
        multimedia messages using the Multimedia Messaging Service (MMS) and Rich 
        <br>
        Communication Services (RCS), which can contain digital images, videos, 
        <br>
        and sound content, as well as ideograms known as emoji (happy faces, sad faces, 
        <br>
        and other icons), and on various instant messaging apps. Text messaging has been 
        <br>
        an extremely popular medium of communication since the turn of the century and has 
        <br>
        also influenced changes in society.[1][2][3][4] Overview
        <br>
        Text messages are used for personal, family, business, and social purposes. 
        <br>
        Governmental and non-governmental organizations use text messaging for communication 
        <br>
        between colleagues. In the 2010s, the sending of short informal messages became an 
        <br>
        accepted part of many cultures, as happened earlier with emailing.[5] This makes texting
        <br>
         a quick and easy way to communicate with friends, family, and colleagues, including in 
        <br>
         contexts where a call would be impolite or inappropriate (e.g., calling very late at night 
        <br>
         or when one knows the other person is busy with family or work activities). Like e-mail and 
        <br>
         voicemail, and unlike calls (in which the caller hopes to speak directly with the recipient), 
        <br>
         texting does not require the caller and recipient to both be free at the same moment; this permits 
        <br>
         communication even between busy individuals. Text messages can also be used to interact with 
        <br>
         automated systems, for example, to order products or services from e-commerce websites or to 
        <br>
         participate in online contests. Advertisers and service providers use direct text marketing to 
        <br>
         send messages to mobile users about promotions, payment due dates, and other notifications instead 
        <br>
         of using postal mail, email, or voicemail.
