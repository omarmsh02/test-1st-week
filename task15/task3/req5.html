            Once there was a young man named Jack. He lived with his <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0116669/">mother</a> on a small farm at the foot of the Foggy Mountains.

            Jack and his mother were very poor. Their only way of making money was selling the milk from their cow, Bess.
