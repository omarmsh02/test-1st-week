        <p>In the 1997 sports comedy film Air Bud, the film's climax rests upon the titular 
            dog character helping the Timberwolves win a basketball game. It's discovered 
            that there's no rule explicitly banning a dog from playing basketball, so Buddy 
            joins the team and wins the game. While it is true that dogs are not banned from 
            playing basketball, there are rules that disqualify most dogs for other reasons.
